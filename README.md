# hseb2-algorithms
2013\. Study projects. Different sorting and other algorithms and data structures implemented in C++.
## Features
part1
1. Bubble sort (also with Iverson condition)
2. Insertion (and binary insertion) sort
3. Counting sort
4. Radix sort
5. Merge sort
6. Heap sort
7. Quick sort
8. Knapsack problem solutions (greedy and using dynamic programming)
9. Time measuring utils and vuzialisation
part2
Various tasks for data structures usage (linked list, stack, queue, hashset, etc.)
